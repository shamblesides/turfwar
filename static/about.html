<h1>Welcome to the IPv4 Games</h1>
<p>I have a simple challenge for you:
<p>Send requests to this web server from lots of <em>different</em> IP addresses.


<h2>How Scoring Works</h2>
<p>The server keeps a record of what name was last sent to it from each IPv4 address.
<p>If you hold more IPv4 addresses in a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assigned_/8_IPv4_address_blocks">/8 address block</a>
    than anyone else, that means you control that block.
<p>Each block you control gives you 1 point.

<h2>How did you make this?</h2>
<p>The frontend is plain HTML and JavaScript (just view the page's source!)
    and the backend is a couple hundred lines of Go with SQLite as the database.
